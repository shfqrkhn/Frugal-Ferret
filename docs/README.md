# Frugal Ferret 🐿️: Your Clever Savings Companion

Welcome, clever saver! You've just discovered Frugal Ferret, your personal, private, and offline-first vault for managing your finances. Think of me as your trusty sidekick, helping you stash your nuts (or, you know, cash) in the smartest places possible.

## Guiding Principles

This isn't your typical finance app. Here's what makes Frugal Ferret special:

*   **🔒 Your Data is Yours, Period.** Everything is stored right here on your device. No servers, no clouds, no prying eyes. Your financial life is your business, and mine is to help you keep it that way.
*   **✈️ Works Anywhere, Anytime.** On a plane? In a subway? No internet? No problem. Frugal Ferret is a full Progressive Web App (PWA) that works completely offline.
*   **🤖 Ferret's Foresight (Optional AI).** Want some extra-clever insights? You can optionally add your own Google Gemini API key in the Settings. The app is 100% functional without it, but it unlocks features like automatic transaction categorization. You're in control.
*   **🍁 Proudly Canadian.** Built with Canadian accounts (TFSA, RRSP, FHSA) and financial contexts in mind.

## Getting Started

Frugal Ferret is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means you can "install" it for a native app-like experience.

*   **On Desktop:** Look for an install icon (usually a computer with a down arrow) in your browser's address bar.
*   **On Mobile:** Use your browser's "Share" menu and select "Add to Home Screen."

Once installed, you're ready to go! There are no accounts to create or passwords to remember.

## A Tour of Your Burrow (Features)

*   **🏠 Dashboard:** Your financial command center. Get a quick overview of your income vs. expenses, see all your account balances, and review your most recent transactions.
*   **💳 Accounts:** This is where all your money lives. Add your chequing, savings, credit card, and investment accounts to get a complete picture of your net worth.
*   **🧾 Transactions:** See a detailed list of every transaction across all your accounts. Use the powerful filters to search by date, description, account, or category. You can add transactions manually or import them from a CSV file.
*   **🌱 Goals & Sinking Funds:** Saving for a vacation, a new car, or a down payment? Create a goal, link it to a savings account, and watch your progress. It's the perfect way to manage your sinking funds.
*   **🎯 Budgets:** Keep your spending in check by creating monthly budgets. Budgets are based on tags, so you can track spending on "Groceries," "Dining Out," or anything else you can think of.
*   **🗓️ Scheduled:** Automate your finances by setting up recurring transactions. Perfect for paychecks, rent, or monthly subscriptions. The app will create them for you on their due date.
*   **⚙️ Settings:** Customize the app to your liking. Here you can manage your payees, categories, and tags. You can also create automation rules, set exchange rates, and add your optional AI API key.

## Data & Privacy

Your privacy is paramount. All your financial data is stored exclusively on your device in your browser's local database. It is never sent to any server.

For peace of mind, you can back up your data at any time. Go to `Settings` -> `More` -> `Debug Panel` -> `Data Actions` to export your entire database as a JSON file. You can use this same panel to import a backup file if you ever need to.
